# Current bugs/known issues

1. Unecrypted passwords, use bcrypt
2. Had to diable csrf on form submit. Cannot debug issue in good time.
3. Logout gives unauthorized when clicked without login. Could hide button or catch error.
4. Assuming cocoon ID not autogenerated by db
5. Needs so much more error handling
6. No tests. Needs API, unit and end to end
